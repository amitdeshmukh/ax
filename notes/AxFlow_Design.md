# AxFlow: Fluent Workflow Orchestration for Complex AI Programs

## Overview

AxFlow is a fluent, chainable API for building and orchestrating complex, stateful AI programs within the Ax framework. It provides a declarative way to define computational nodes and an imperative way to compose them using loops, conditionals, and dynamic context switching.

## Why AxFlow is Needed

### The Problem: Complex AI Workflows Are Hard to Build

As AI applications become more sophisticated, developers face several challenges when building complex workflows:

1. **State Management Complexity**: Traditional approaches require manual state threading between multiple AI operations, leading to verbose and error-prone code.

2. **Lack of Composability**: Existing solutions don't provide clean abstractions for composing multiple AI operations while maintaining type safety and readability.

3. **Dynamic Context Requirements**: Real-world applications often need to use different AI models for different tasks (e.g., a fast model for summarization, a powerful model for analysis), but current frameworks make this cumbersome.

4. **Control Flow Limitations**: Building workflows with loops, conditionals, and complex branching logic requires significant boilerplate code and state management.

5. **Reusability Challenges**: AI programs are difficult to decompose into reusable components that can be shared across different workflows.

### The Solution: AxFlow's Design Philosophy

AxFlow addresses these challenges through several key design principles:

**1. Declarative Node Definition + Imperative Composition**
```typescript
// Declare what you want to compute
.node('summarizer', { 'text:string': { summary: f.string() } })
.node('analyzer', { 'text:string': { analysis: f.string() } })

// Compose how you want to compute it
.execute('summarizer', state => ({ text: state.input }))
.execute('analyzer', state => ({ text: state.input }))
```

**2. Fluent Interface for Readability**
The entire workflow reads like a natural description of the process, making it easy to understand and maintain.

**3. Dynamic Context Switching**
Different parts of the workflow can use different AI models without breaking the flow:
```typescript
.execute('summarizer', mapping, { ai: cheapAI })
.execute('analyzer', mapping, { ai: powerfulAI })
```

**4. Built-in Control Flow**
Loops and conditionals are first-class citizens:
```typescript
.while(state => state.iterations < 3)
  .map(state => ({ ...state, iterations: state.iterations + 1 }))
.endWhile()
```

## Core Design Concepts

### 1. State-Centric Architecture

AxFlow is built around the concept of a flowing state object that gets transformed through each step of the workflow. This design provides:

- **Immutability by Convention**: Each transformation returns a new state object
- **Full Context Preservation**: All intermediate results are maintained in the state
- **Flexible Data Flow**: State can be reshaped at any point using `.map()`

### 2. Node-Based Computation Model

Computational nodes are declared separately from their usage, providing:

- **Reusability**: Nodes can be used multiple times with different inputs
- **Type Safety**: Each node has a well-defined input/output signature
- **Testability**: Nodes can be tested in isolation
- **Performance**: Node generators are created once and reused

### 3. Context-Aware Execution

Each execution step can override the default AI service and options:

```typescript
.execute('node', mapping, { 
  ai: specializedAI, 
  options: { temperature: 0.1 } 
})
```

This enables:
- **Model Specialization**: Use the right model for each task
- **Cost Optimization**: Use cheaper models where appropriate
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different models in the same workflow

## Implementation Details

### Type System Design

AxFlow uses TypeScript generics to maintain type safety throughout the workflow:

```typescript
class AxFlow<IN extends AxGenIn, OUT extends AxGenOut>
```

- `IN`: Defines the expected input structure
- `OUT`: Defines the expected output structure
- State transformations are type-checked at compile time

### State Management

The state object flows through the workflow and accumulates results:

```typescript
// Initial state: { topic: "AI" }
// After summarizer: { topic: "AI", summarizerResult: { summary: "..." } }
// After analyzer: { topic: "AI", summarizerResult: {...}, analyzerResult: { analysis: "..." } }
```

Node results are automatically namespaced using the pattern `${nodeName}Result` to avoid conflicts.

### Loop Implementation

Loops are implemented using a stack-based approach:

1. `.while()` pushes a loop start marker onto the stack
2. Steps between `.while()` and `.endWhile()` are collected
3. `.endWhile()` pops the stack and creates the loop logic
4. The loop executes all collected steps repeatedly until the condition fails

### Node Signature Conversion

AxFlow converts its object-based signature format to string-based signatures for compatibility with AxGen:

```typescript
// Input: { 'text:string': { summary: f.string() } }
// Output: "text:string -> summary:string"
```

This provides a more ergonomic API while maintaining compatibility with the existing Ax ecosystem.

## Architectural Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **Declaration**: What computations are available (nodes)
- **Orchestration**: How computations are composed (flow)
- **Execution**: When and with what context (dynamic overrides)

### 2. Incremental Complexity

Workflows can start simple and grow in complexity:

```typescript
// Simple: Single node execution
const simple = new AxFlow()
  .node('processor', signature)
  .execute('processor', mapping)

// Complex: Multi-node with loops and dynamic context
const complex = new AxFlow()
  .node('summarizer', sig1)
  .node('analyzer', sig2)
  .while(condition)
    .execute('summarizer', mapping1, { ai: cheapAI })
    .execute('analyzer', mapping2, { ai: powerfulAI })
  .endWhile()
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Node Reuse**: AxGen instances are created once and reused
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Only executes when `.forward()` is called
- **Efficient State Management**: State objects are passed by reference where possible

## Integration with Ax Ecosystem

AxFlow extends `AxProgramWithSignature`, making it compatible with:

- **Optimizers**: Can be tuned using MiPRO, Bootstrap Few Shot, etc.
- **Streaming**: Supports streaming execution through the underlying AxGen instances
- **Tracing**: Inherits OpenTelemetry support from the Ax ecosystem
- **Examples**: Can use examples and demonstrations like other Ax programs

## Use Cases and Patterns

### 1. Multi-Model Workflows

Using different AI models for different tasks:

```typescript
const workflow = new AxFlow()
  .node('draft', { 'topic:string': { content: f.string() } })
  .node('review', { 'content:string': { feedback: f.string() } })
  .node('finalize', { 'content:string, feedback:string': { final: f.string() } })
  .execute('draft', mapping, { ai: fastAI })
  .execute('review', mapping, { ai: expertAI })
  .execute('finalize', mapping, { ai: balancedAI })
```

### 2. Iterative Refinement

Loops for progressive improvement:

```typescript
const refiner = new AxFlow()
  .node('improve', { 'text:string': { improved: f.string() } })
  .while(state => state.quality < 0.9)
    .execute('improve', state => ({ text: state.current }))
    .map(state => ({ ...state, current: state.improveResult.improved }))
  .endWhile()
```

### 3. Conditional Branching

Different processing paths based on state:

```typescript
const processor = new AxFlow()
  .map(state => {
    if (state.type === 'urgent') {
      return { ...state, useAdvancedModel: true }
    }
    return { ...state, useAdvancedModel: false }
  })
  .execute('processor', mapping, state => state.useAdvancedModel ? 
    { ai: powerfulAI } : { ai: basicAI })
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Parallel Execution

Support for executing multiple nodes in parallel:

```typescript
.parallel([
  ['summarizer', mapping1],
  ['analyzer', mapping2]
])
```

### 2. Error Handling and Retry Logic

Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms:

```typescript
.execute('unreliableNode', mapping, { 
  retries: 3, 
  backoff: 'exponential' 
})
```

### 3. Sub-Flow Composition

Ability to compose AxFlow instances:

```typescript
.subflow('preprocessing', preprocessingFlow)
.subflow('analysis', analysisFlow)
```

### 4. Conditional Execution

Native support for conditional node execution:

```typescript
.if(state => state.needsAnalysis)
  .execute('analyzer', mapping)
.endif()
```

## Comparison to Alternatives

### vs. Direct AxGen Composition

**AxGen Approach:**
```typescript
const summarizer = new AxGen('text:string -> summary:string')
const analyzer = new AxGen('text:string -> analysis:string')

const text = input.topic
const summaryResult = await summarizer.forward(ai, { text })
const analysisResult = await analyzer.forward(ai, { text })
const result = { summary: summaryResult.summary, analysis: analysisResult.analysis }
```

**AxFlow Approach:**
```typescript
const flow = new AxFlow()
  .node('summarizer', { 'text:string': { summary: f.string() } })
  .node('analyzer', { 'text:string': { analysis: f.string() } })
  .execute('summarizer', state => ({ text: state.topic }))
  .execute('analyzer', state => ({ text: state.topic }))
  .map(state => ({
    summary: state.summarizerResult.summary,
    analysis: state.analyzerResult.analysis
  }))

const result = await flow.forward(ai, input)
```

**AxFlow Benefits:**
- Declarative node definitions enable reusability
- Built-in state management
- Type safety throughout the flow
- Easy to add control flow (loops, conditions)
- Dynamic context switching
- Better composition and testing
