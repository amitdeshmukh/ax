    // Enhanced features (NEW)
    programAwareProposer: true,  // Use program structure
    dataAwareProposer: true,     // Use dataset analysis
    bayesianOptimization: true,  // Use surrogate model
    acquisitionFunction: 'expected_improvement',
    
    // Adaptive evaluation
    minibatch: true,
    minibatchSize: 25,
    minibatchFullEvalSteps: 10,
